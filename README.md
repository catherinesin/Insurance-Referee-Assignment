Course Project: Insurance Referee Assignment Problem 
Course: Knowledge Representation

## Insurance Referee Assignment Problem
This reading provides an overview of what you’ll be doing for this course's project, how you’ll be doing it, and how your project work will be evaluated. It includes the actual project materials as well as covers other important project information to ensure that you are fully prepared to complete the course project successfully. You are encouraged to use this reading as a reference resource for the project throughout the course.

## Introduction
For this course's project, you will work individually to develop the skill of solving real world problem using logic programming. The project were included in the ASP Challenge 2019 and present an opportunity for you to demonstrate your ability to contribute to industrial applications of knowledge representation and reasoning, specifically industry application of answer set programming (ASP). The project will require that you meet milestones by submitting deliverables throughout the course and will account for 30% of your grade. It will therefore qualify for inclusion in your MCS Portfolio. 

## Project 
As mentioned above, the problem at the center of this course’s  project option were included in the ASP Challenge 2019 Links to an external site., Links to an external site. which invited companies to provide descriptions and instances of industrial problems from areas that are traditionally of interest to the community of answer set programming (ASP). The participants of the challenge were called upon to solve these and several other problems by means of ASP and extensions thereof. To this end, the participants were able to use any available ASP system to solve the problem at hand. For the course projects, however, all students will use clingo (for an introduction to clingo,. As the project was for the challenge’s participants, solution to the problem will be evaluated based on their correctness and efficiency using the problem instances supplied by the companies.

## Project Materials
In addition to the downloaded package for the project , you will need to use a report kit as the template to write your project reports. Please download the "Project Report Kit" that follows. It is adapted from the Author Kit used by theAssociation for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence Links to an external site. , the organization whose conventions and style manual Links to an external site. you will be expected to use for the project reports.


Scenario: An insurance company needs to check whether customer claims are justified. To this end, the company sends referees (commonly referred to as insurance or claims "adjusters" in the United States) to different locations to inspect damages (e.g., damaged cars) and write reports. The insurance company employs its own referees (internal referees) but can also authorize external referees to handle cases when volume warrants. 

Challenge: The overall task is to assign referees to insurance cases according to various hard constraints and weak constraints using the clingo program to find the assignment satisfying the input constraints. This is a static world problem, meaning that the status of each object does not change over time (e.g., the payment of each case does not change over time).

Preparation: You will start to write hard constraints from the first milestone and will learn how to write more complex hard constraints in module 4 and module 5. You will also need to learn how to write weak constraints according to the following reading materials by module 5 since weak constraints are necessary for the project and also for you to prepare for the Individual Progress Report due is Nov 20.

**Instances are the test cases that will help you to debug your code ( Test your implementation)

The following four-page introduction to weak constraints: intro_weak_constraints.pdf  

Section 3.1.13 in the following Clingo Guide (about two pages long)

Objective: Show that you can represent various hard and weak constraints in KR languages and automate reasoning using KR tools.
